### Data is from the Patient_Info dataset from South Korea 1 Jan to 1 May 2020
### This data was retrieved from a downloadable zip file from kaggle

Some of the data was uncoded for sex - sex must be just male or female
77 of the data entries were coded sex  as blank, so we omit these.
state of a patient must be died or alive - we adjust that as well   
  
# Your Question - Is dying independent of sex?






## Graphical results - use ggplot commands to do this  


```{r}
barchartGC(~result + Sex,data=kRdata)
barchartGC(~result + Sex,data=kRdata, type="percent")

```
  





  
  Most of the people alive were female, making up about 55%, while males were around 45%. But when it came to those who died, about 65% were male and 45% were female. This shows that more males died compared to females, with males making up a much larger part of the deaths, almost twice as many as females.
